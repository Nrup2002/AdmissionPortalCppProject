# AdmissionPortalCppProject
The Student Admission Portal Management System is a basic necessity of Educational establishments or Industries to manage student data and many other student-related data and operations needed in a school during the student admission process.

*This C++ project was created to explore and demonstrate my knowledge of C++ features.*

The system has three modules :
-   -> Admin   Login
-   -> Student Login
   
Most of the features of object-oriented programming are used.
-   -> Classes and Objects
-   -> Data Abstraction and Encapsulation
-   -> Polymorphism: Function Overloading
-   -> Constructor and Destructor
-   -> Single Inheritance
-   -> File Handling
-   -> Also function overriding, Friend Function and Template
